      In this class project, I looked at data available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health for restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. 
      The goal was to use the process of data cleaning and EDA. <br>
      First off, when cleaning the data, I noticed that there were errors in the data. For example, I had to make sure that the zip codes were actually valid SF 
      postal codes and that the restaurant names followed the same format like having the first letter capitalized.<br>
