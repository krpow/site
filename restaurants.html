                              <h4 class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.3s">Data Analysis of Restaurant Food Safety Scores in SF</h4>
                              <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.9s">In this class project, I looked at data available by the San Francisco Department of 
				      Public Health for restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. The goal was to use the process of data cleaning 
				      and EDA.</p>
				<p>First off, when cleaning the data, I noticed that there were errors in the data. For example, I had to make sure that the zip 
					codes were actually valid SF postal codes and that the restaurant names followed the same format like having the first letter capitalized.</p>

                    </div>
               </div>
          </div>
     </div>

				<p>So this is the distribution of inspections scores for restaurants in SF. From this chart, I noticed that the mode score is 100, 
					it is left-tailed, and there doesn't seem to be any outliers. Although there are restaurant with scores lower than 90 and 
					some even lower than 70, there's a great deal of restaurants with high scores and many with a perfect score, which is good to know.</p>
				<p>*Interesting fact I computed from the data: Out of the total number of violations in the risk category, most restaurant violations are in the
					low risk category. If it were the other way around, I would be concerned.</p>

				<p>Then, I compared the relationships between the first and second scores for businesses with just 2 inspections in a year with a scatterplot. 
					For the scatter plot, if a restaurants' scores tend to improve from the first to the second inspection, I would expect to see more 
					points above the reference line where the slope = 1 because that would indicate the second score was higher than the first. 
					The reference line is where the first score = the second score, so anything above it indicates that the second score was higher 
					than the first. However, this is not happening in the observations as many restaurants' second score is lower than the first.</p>

				<p>Another way to compare scores from the 2 inspections is to examine the difference in scores by using a histogram. For the histogram, if a 
					restaurants' scores tend to improve from the first to the second inspection, I would expect to see more positive points on the 
					histogram and the spread would be more left-skewed. From the plot, the distribution is centered around 0, with a few values at around 
					-25 and 25 (long tails). Since the distribution is centered at 0, the second inspection is usually pretty similar to the first inspection 
					(there isn't much change), so the differences aren't too big.</p>
