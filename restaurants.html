      <center>Data Analysis of Restaurant Food Safety Scores in SF</center>
    </h1>
    <center>
      In this class project, I looked at data available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health for restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco. 
      The goal was to use the process of data cleaning and EDA. <br><br>
      First off, when cleaning the data, I noticed that there were errors in the data. For example, I had to make sure that the zip codes were actually valid SF 
      postal codes and that the restaurant names followed the same format like having the first letter capitalized.<br><br><br>

    So this is the distribution of inspections scores for restaurants in SF. From this chart, I noticed that the mode score is 100, it is left-tailed, and there 
    doesn't seem to be any outliers. Although there are restaurant with scores lower than 90 and some even lower than 70, there's a great deal of restaurants with 
    high scores and many with a perfect score, which is good to know.<br><br><br>
      
      *Interesting fact I computed from the data: Out of the total number of violations in the risk category, most restaurant violations are in the low risk category.
      If it were the other way around, I would be concerned.<br><br>

      Then, I compared the relationships between the first and second scores for businesses with just 2 inspections in a year with a scatterplot. For the scatter 
      plot, if a restaurants' scores tend to improve from the first to the second inspection, I would expect to see more points above the reference line where the 
      slope = 1 because that would indicate the second score was higher than the first. The reference line is where the first score = the second score, so anything
      above it indicates that the second score was higher than the first. However, this is not happening in the observations as many restaurants' second score is 
      lower than the first. <br><br><br>

      Another way to compare scores from the 2 inspections is to examine the difference in scores by using a histogram. For the histogram, if a restaurants' scores 
      tend to improve from the first to the second inspection, I would expect to see more positive points on the histogram and the spread would be more left-skewed.
      From the plot, the distribution is centered around 0, with a few values at around -25 and 25 (long tails). Since the distribution is centered at 0, the second
      inspection is usually pretty similar to the first inspection (there isn't much change), so the differences aren't too big. <br><br>
