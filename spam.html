      In this class project, I built a classifier that could distinguish between spam and ham(non-spam) emails. <br><br>
      I first divided the dataset into a training and test dataset. Then, I checked the data for any missing values. If a cell had a missing value, I would fill 
      them with the appropriate value like empty cells in the "subject" column would be replaced with empty strings.Â <br><br>
