      In this class project, I built a classifier that could distinguish between spam and ham(non-spam) emails. <br><br>
      I first divided the dataset into a training and test dataset. Then, I checked the data for any missing values. If a cell had a missing value, I would fill 
      them with the appropriate value like empty cells in the "subject" column would be replaced with empty strings. <br><br>

      When looking at some spam and ham emails in the training data, I noticed that the subject line for a ham email is usually longer than a spam email.<br><br>
      <h2>Evaluating Classifiers</h2>
      I needed to identify which features would be helpful to distinguish spam emails from ham emails. I first looked at the number of characters in the subject and
      number of words in emails of spam emails compared to ham emails, creating a conditional density plot. I also looked at other possible features that could help
      distinguish between ham and spam emails like punctuation and captial letters. Looking at the plots, it is very hard to see how some features could help to 
      determine whether an email was spam or not. I was surprised to see that spam and ham emails were about the same length, so length of emails was not a good 
      feature. I was surprised that spam emails were more likely to have more ! in the email.<br><br>

      Once finding the best features for distinguishing the two kinds of emails, I was able to create a logistic regression model to predict spam and ham emails 
      with a training accuracy of 0.91.<br><br>
      I also created a heat map to look at the correlation between the words I picked for my logistic regression model.<br><br>
