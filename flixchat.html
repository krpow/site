      <h2>Background</h2>
        Early June, I participated in my first design competition (College + Netflix Creative Jam) hosted by Adobe XD with my good friend from UC Berkeley. UX/UI 
        and design is all very new to me, so weeks before the competition, I watched many YouTube tutorials on Adobe XD and design to prepare.<br><br>
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      To design a third-party desktop website where the community can celebrate shared stories together through communal and authentic experiences.<br><br>
      <h2>Day 1</h2>
      After thinking about the challenge on our own, my friend and I regrouped to share ideas. We agreed that we wanted the site to be simple, clean and resemble a 
      social media account like Facebook and Instagram, so we decided that our main colors would be blue and white. We also talked about the features we wanted have
      on the site and what pages we would need.<br><br>
