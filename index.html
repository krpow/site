    Hello.
  </h1>
  <body>
    <p>An SF native, I am a rising senior at UC Berkeley studying Economics with a minor in Data Science. 
      College was and still is a time for me to explore career interests, new hobbies, push myself out of my comfort 
      zone and discover myself. The biggest lesson that I have learned in college is that the life is full of rejections
      and no's, but if you let that define your decisions, then you will only live with regrets and what ifs.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about pursuing meaningful projects that will have an impact on people's lives and communities.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy going out to play some tennis. I am also a big foodie and am constantly on the lookout
      for new places to try.</p>
