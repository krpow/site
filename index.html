          An SF native, I am a rising senior at UC Berkeley studying Economics with a minor in Data Science. 
        <br><br>
          I am passionate about pursuing meaningful projects that will have an impact on people's lives and communities.
        <br><br>
          In my free time, I enjoy going out to play some tennis. I am also a big foodie and am constantly on the lookout 
          for new places to try.
